## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Analyst with a background in International Business and hands-on experience in investment project evaluation, analytics, and strategic decision-making. My technical toolkit includes Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly), SQL, Tableau, and Streamlit. I've developed dashboards, modularized pipelines, and delivered insights across various projectsâ€”from business analysis and A/B testing to predictive modeling and data-driven storytelling.

I'm deeply interested in the current paradigm shift around artificial intelligenceâ€”not only in its disruptive potential but also in its integration into real-world workflows. I actively experiment with AI tools to streamline analysis, enhance productivity, and build solutions combining automation and human insight.

I aim to deliver value through actionable insights, strategic thinking, and robust, interpretable solutionsâ€”bridging the gap between data, business, and innovation.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

**Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**: I have already learned the basics and have applied these tools in multiple bootcamp projects, but I like to keep learning and mastering them. 

I use **GPT** as a strategic **coding partner** for **Python-based data analysis**. While I understand the core logic and capabilities of the language, I delegate much of the coding to AI in order to work more efficiently, focusing my time on interpreting **insights**, improving workflows, solving technical issues, and asking better questions. 

I also applied **prompt engineering** techniques to build a customized GPT assistant called **Data_Partner**, designed to support my analytical workflow with context-aware responses and problem-solving capabilities.

I also like to keep up with the ever-changing paradigm we are experiencing right now, with AI advancements happening every day. I'm currently interested in researching and knowing tools like: lovable | n8n | make.com | firebase.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:

Junior data analysis rolesâ€”particularly in business-focused analysis for retail or tech companies. Iâ€™m passionate about data analytics, AI, and business intelligence as powerful, transversal disciplines. Iâ€™d love to contribute to decision-making processes that spark action, improve operations, and deliver measurable results.

## âš¡ Fun fact: 

I am a Big **One Piece** Fan, I find it super inspiring.
